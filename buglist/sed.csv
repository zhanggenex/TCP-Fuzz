6,"sed escape bug. The escape '\c\' fails at the end of a regex. It's a bug in older sed-4.2.2, but the fix is perhaps not your expected behaviour of allowing '/' after '\c\'. ","lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-sed/2017-02/msg00017.html"

12,"sed/utils.c temporary file handling code review. The code handling temporary file seems to be fragile and contains dead chunks. ck_fclose() is (theoretically) vulnerable into a double close, because open_files still contains file being closed while calling do_ck_fclose(). In some error conditions, do_ck_fclose() can call panic(), which manipulates with open_files and tries to fclose() all files there, including that one just closed.", "lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-sed/2015-11/msg00001.html"
