Requesting confirmation that this is  |     not a duplicate of CVE-2000-0092: The BSD make program allows local users to  |     modify files via a symlink attack when the -j option is being used.)  |   Christey> To confirm Andre's question, this is being treated as  |     different from CVE-2000-0092, based largely on the fact  |     that the exploit is different.  I believe there was  |     another reason for keeping these distinct, but that  |     ""deeper analysis"" was not recorded :-(  While it's possible  |     that this is the same bug from some common version of make,  |     in the absence of other information we should probably  |     keep these two split.  |   CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]  |   CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]  |   Christey> Taking a fresh look at the diff's for FreeBSD make:  |     ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-00:01.make.asc  |     And Debian make:  |     http://security.debian.org/dists/slink/updates/source/make_3.77-5slink.diff.gz  |       |     OK... now that I've hurt my brain looking at the code, while  |     there are major differences in the surrounding code,  |     ultimately both FreeBSD and Debian create an ""outfile"" file  |     descriptor for the temporary file, within main() in main.c.  |     In addition, child_execute_job() in job.c uses an outfile  |     variable - for both sources.  |       |     Perhaps FreeBSD reported the -j problem without seeing that it  |     could come in from stdin as well, and/or Debian/etc. didn't realize  |     that it was exploitable from job control, or maybe a combination of  |     the two.  Regardless, the two problems are the same.  |       |     Phew!  There goes a half-hour of my life that I'll never be  |     able to get back..."

When parsing a "make -p" output, an unexpected "+=" was seen in a context where ":=" was expected (a target-specific variable being assigned with "=" to a pattern target, e.g. "%.x: FOO = x"). The bug is extremely unstable; it required the exact build directory, and a particular amount of data in the environment.
